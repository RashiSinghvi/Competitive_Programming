Problem-Statement:-

You will be given a array name as "arr" of size "n",and a singal integer "k".you must create an array of length k from elements in arr such that its unfairness is minimized.call that array subarr.unfairness of an array is calculated as
                        max(subarr)-min(subarr)
where
1) max denote the largest integer in subarr
2) min denote the minimum integer in subarr

as an Example,consider the array [1,4,7,2] with a k of 2.pick any two element,test subarr=[4,7]
unfairness=max(4,7)-min(4,7)=7-4=3
Testing for all pairs.the solution [1,2] provide the minimum unfairness.

Example
k=3
size of array n=7
arr={10,100,300,200,1000,20,30}
